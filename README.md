# MotortownBTW-Save-File-Backup

Heres a shell file created to go into your Motortown Saved folder, and copy your Game's Save file into a backup location on the desktop. It saves it to a subfolder with the date of when the code was ran.

This shell script can be ran automatically thourgh Task Schedular, or manually whenever you want to. This script posses no malicious code, however I do no recommend anyone running code a random user on dsicord sent, so use at your own discression.
